Hi, my name is Sagi Buchbinder-Shadur.

I'm a software engineer originally from Israel who now resides in Atlanta, USA.
Since February 2024, I have worked as a Senior Software Engineer at Microsoft's High-Performance Computing division, 
leading machine learning research and Co-Pilot integration.

As a coder, I mostly write code in Python nowadays, but I have rich experience writing code in Java and C++.

I LOVE open source. I believe that open-source code is humanity's way of sharing knowledge and power with everyone, everywhere, at all times.
Over the years, I've contributed code to many open-source projects and do that as frequently as possible.

I'm the founder of the [Eddington](https://github.com/EddLabs) platform, an open-source data fitting platform, 
and [Statue](https://github.com/saroad2/statue), an orchestration tool for static code analysis.

My creativity extends beyond software development. 
I'm also a published poet, with three Hebrew poetry books to my name: "Mountains and Hills" (2018), "The Emissary" (2020), and "Mad New World" (2022), all published in Israel.
