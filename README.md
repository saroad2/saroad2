Hi, my name is Sagi Shadur.

I'm a software developer from Israel. Nowadays I mostly write code in Python, but I have a rich experience writing code in Java and C++.
I'm working as a Machine Learning Team Lead at Proxima Investments Inc.

I LOVE open source. I believe that open source code is our way as humanity to share knowledge and power with everyone, everywhere at everytime.
Along the years I've contributed code to many open source projects and I try to do that as frequently as I can.

I'm a maintainer at [Beeware](https://github.com/beeware) which is a project that truely dear to me.
I'm also the founder of the [Eddington](https://github.com/EddLabs) platform which is an open-source platform for data fitting and 
[Statue](https://github.com/saroad2/statue) which is an orchestration tool for static code analysis.
